# latch-android

## What this is
The Android client of Latch: captures dates and deadlines from text anywhere on the phone,
parses them on device, and writes them to the user's Google Calendar and Google Tasks.
There is no backend, and no user content reaches any publisher server.

## Specification
The authoritative requirements are in `docs/SRS.md`. Requirements are numbered
(FR-nnn functional, NFR-nnn non-functional). When implementing, cite the
requirement ID in your summary so work can be traced back.

## Module structure
| Module | Type | Holds |
|---|---|---|
| `:app` | Android application | Capture entry points, first-run setup, Compose confirmation UI |
| `:core-model` | pure Kotlin (JVM) | Domain types from SRS §7.1 |
| `:parser` | pure Kotlin (JVM) | Date and time extraction, classification (FR-500 series) |
| `:recipes` | pure Kotlin (JVM) | Working-day arithmetic, recipe expansion (FR-600 series) |
| `:data` | Android library | Storage contracts — Inbox, write queue, secret store, account defaults — and the Google API contracts the setup and write paths call |

Dependencies point one way: `:app` → `:data`/`:parser`/`:recipes` → `:core-model`.
`:parser` and `:recipes` do not depend on each other; they exchange `:core-model` types.

## How to build and test
Requires JDK 17+ on `JAVA_HOME`. Android Studio's bundled JBR works:
`C:\Program Files\Android\Android Studio\jbr` (JDK 21). Gradle and the Android SDK
components download on first run; `local.properties` needs `sdk.dir` and is not committed.

```
./gradlew build                # everything: compile, unit tests, lint, debug + release APK
./gradlew :parser:test         # the parser corpus alone — seconds, no emulator
./gradlew :app:assembleDebug   # debug APK
```

## Hard constraints
Do not violate these without asking first:
- **`:parser` and `:recipes` stay pure Kotlin.** No Android dependency, no third-party
  dependency. This is what makes FR-501 and NFR-502 enforceable by the build rather than by
  review, and it keeps the corpus running without a device.
- **Never invent a date** (design principle 1). No date found means an undated item, never
  "today". A missing year means the current year, never rolled forward — AC-04 depends on it.
- **Nothing leaves the device** except the finished Calendar/Tasks entry (design principle 2,
  NFR-201). The one exception is a user-configured FR-1004 webhook, off by default, never
  for notification-sourced captures (FR-210a), never in the write queue (FR-1004b).
- **No `MediaProjection`** (FR-217) and **no Accessibility Service** (FR-218).
- **Ask before adding a dependency** (NFR-501). Each one needs a written justification in
  `docs/DEPENDENCIES.md`, with its measured APK impact. Anything not listed there has not
  been justified.
- **All user-facing strings live in `app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml`** (NFR-402). The
  pure-Kotlin modules return data, never display text — see `ShiftResult` for how FR-606's
  "weekend skipped" message is left to the app to phrase.

## Conventions
- Kotlin, Compose with Material 3, `java.time` (available natively at minSdk 26, no desugaring).
- AGP 9 has built-in Kotlin support: do **not** apply `org.jetbrains.kotlin.android` to the
  Android modules. The Compose compiler plugin is still applied separately.
- Versions live in `gradle/libs.versions.toml`. Nothing is version-pinned in a module file.
- Comments explain decisions the code cannot state — why a heuristic leans the way it does,
  which requirement forces a shape. They do not restate the code.
- Parser rules take `ParseContext.now` and never read the clock, so every case is reproducible.

## Commits
Commit directly to `main`. This is a single-developer repository with no CI and no review
step, so a feature branch adds ceremony without adding safety — there is nothing for it to
gate. This overrides the default habit of branching before committing to the default branch.

Subject line in the present tense, imperative, one line. The body carries the reasoning:
which requirements the change serves, and any decision the code cannot state for itself.

## State of the build
Skeleton only. Working: the five-module structure, the parser (87-case corpus, all passing),
working-day arithmetic and recipe expansion, capture layers 1, 2 and 4 as far as the
confirmation screen, and first-run setup (FR-100 series) end to end.

Setup runs against `StubGoogle.kt`, not Google. The screens, the state machine and the commit
sequence are finished and tested; the four API calls behind them are stubs, because how this
app talks to Google is an open NFR-501 decision (hand-written REST against the endpoints, or
a Google client library). Replacing the stubs changes nothing above them. Defaults are held
in memory, so every launch runs setup again.

Not built: any real Google API call (FR-800 series), the Capture Inbox (FR-700 series),
Settings (FR-1000 series), OCR (FR-215) and the notification listener (FR-208). The app holds
no `INTERNET` permission yet, which is the strongest possible form of AC-17.

FR-105 is load-bearing and structural, not a matter of care: `com.latch.android.setup` is
pure Kotlin, `SetupEffect.Commit` is the only effect that can reach `calendars.insert`, and
`SetupEvent.FinishRequested` is the only event that produces one. AC-15 and AC-16 are JVM
unit tests over that reducer. Keep it that way.
